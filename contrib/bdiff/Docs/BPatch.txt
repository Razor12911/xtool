NAME

bpatch - apply binary batch


SYNOPSIS

bpatch [options] old-file [ new-file ] [<patch-file]


DESCRIPTION

bpatch applies a binary patch generated by bdiff. Patches are read from standard
input unless the --input option is used to specify an input file.

old-file is the same file as used as the first argument to bdiff. bpatch will
create a copy of the file given as second argument to bdiff in new-file by using
the information from old-file and patch-file.

If new-file is omitted, the old file is replaced with the new file.

bpatch will detect if the patch does not match old-file, or if the patch has
been garbled. Remember to transmit binary patches as binary files!

In case of an error, new-file will not be touched.
